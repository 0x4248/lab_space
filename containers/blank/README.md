# Blank lab space
Welcome to this lab space. Here you can test whatever you want.

## File structure
The file structure is as follows:
```
.
├── Makefile
├── README.md
└── src
    └── README.md

```

## Running
To run the code, you can use the `make` command but first you need to edit it.

There are several variables that you can edit in the `Makefile` file. These are:
- `COMMAND`: The command that you want to run. This is the command that will be run when you run `make`.
- `MAIN`: The input that you want to give to the command. This is the input that will be given to the command when you run `make`.
- `OUTPUT`: The output that you want to get from the command. This is the output that will be compared with the output of the command when you run `make`.
- `OUTPUT_FILE`: The file that you want to get from the command. This is the file that will be compared with the file that the command creates when you run `make`.

You can edit these variables in the `Makefile` file.
